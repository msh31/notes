## What-is-a-data-stucture

Simply said, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data, but a more precise description would be that a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data. 

## Types
- Array
	- An array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same time (depends on language). The elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations are usually stored in memory as one big block, with each item placed right next to the other without gaps.
- Linked list
	- A linked list (or just simply ``list``) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has a value, and points to the next node in the list.
- Record
	- A record (also known as a ``tuple`` or a ``struct``) is a value that contains other values, typically fixed in number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually referred to as ``fields`` or ``members``.
- Hash tables
	- Hash tables (also known as a hash maps) are data structures that provide fast retrieval of values based on keys ([[C++ data types#Key-Value Storage]]) 
- Graphs
- Stacks & Queues
	- Stacks & Queues are abstract data types that can be implemented  using arrays or linked lists. A stack has 2 primary operations; ``Push`` (add element on top of the stack) and Pop (removes the top most element from the stack) that both follow the `Last In First Out ` principle. Queues also have 2 main operations ``enqueue`` (adds an element to the rear or the queue) and ``dequeue`` (removes an element from the front of the queue) which follows the `First In First Out` principle.
- Trees
