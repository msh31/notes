## What-is-a-data-stucture

Simply said, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data, but a more precise description would be that a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data. 

## Types
- Array
	- 
- Linked list
	- A linked list (or just simply ``list``) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has a value, and points to the next node in the list.
- Record
	- A record (also known as a ``tuple`` or a ``struct``) is a value that contains other values, typically fixed in number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually referred to as ``fields`` or ``members``.
- Hash tables
