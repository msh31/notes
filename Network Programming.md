## Winsock -
Winsock is an API that defines how Windows network application's should access network services, especially TCP/IP. it defines a standard interface between a Windows TCP/IP application (e.g. an FTP client or web browser) and the underlying TCP/IP [[Networking Concepts#Protocol-Stack]].

Examples and information for using winsockets can be found here [[Network Programming#Code examples]]
